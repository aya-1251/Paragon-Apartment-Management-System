# Completing your assessment

## What am I required to do on this assessment?

This is a **GROUP** assignment and to be completed in **groups of up to five (5) students**. As a group you have been asked to analyse the following case study, perform requirement analysis, design, implement and test the above system. Please note **responsibilities for each group member** should be clearly defined as marks will be adjusted based on your individual as well as group contributions. Therefore, you must maintain **evidence logs of your contributions** to the project e.g., through regular Git commits. **Please note that group with less than 4 members is not permitted.**

More specifically:
* The assessment requires you to analyse, design and implement an object-oriented system (a desktop application) based on the following case study.
* You will analyse requirements and produce detailed object models and designs from system requirements.
* Use the modelling concepts provided by Unified Modelling Language (UML).
* You’ll have a question and answers session with your tutor(s) to explain your analysis and design as a group.
* Using your design, you will implement the software and perform software testing by applying a combination of manual and automated testing tools.
* You will apply software methodology on the project.
* Finally, you will demonstrate your system and answer questions about your design, software implementation and the use of your software development approach as a group.

## Case Study: Paragon Apartment Management System (PAMS)

**Problem statement:** The Paragon apartment management company has a multi-location structure with offices spread across the UK, including Bristol, Cardiff, London, and Manchester. The company faces a series of interconnected operational challenges stemming from its decentralized structure, which complicates coordination and fosters inconsistent data handling practices. A heavy reliance on manual, paper-based processing for critical functions like tenant applications and rent collection creates inefficiencies and increases the risk of errors. Compounding these issues are significant access and security problems, as the lack of clear role-based permissions exposes sensitive tenant and financial data to potential unauthorized access. Furthermore, tenant records are not synchronized across cities, leading to duplication and data inconsistency, while the existing system's inability to scale results in performance issues during peak hours. This outdated infrastructure also fails to provide management with the real-time reporting needed for insights into occupancy or financial performance, and its poor usability necessitates extensive staff training. The key challenge, therefore, is to design and develop a consolidated, scalable, and secure Software solution that is intuitive to use and capable of supporting complex, multi-city operations with robust role-based access control. The Paragon company has requested a Software Development team (your IT company) to provide a solution. They require a software solution from your Development Team to ensure stakeholder requirements are met during the design and implementation phases.

Their initial list of essential components includes Account / User Management, Tenant Management, Apartment Management, Payment & Billing, Report Generation, and maintenance.

&lt;page_number&gt;Page 3 of 12&lt;/page_number&gt;

## Page 4

Furthermore, they want a robust solution including the following key components:

**Account /User Management component:**
Account/user management component is defined by four core roles:
*   **Front-desk Staff** can register new tenants and access information to handle tenant inquiries. For the registration of a new tenant, the front-desk staff requires tenant's National Insurance (NI) number, name, phone number, email, occupation, references, apartment requirements (such as two-bedroom house), lease period, and core fields that you think are important. The front-desk staff are also responsible for registering and tracking maintenance requests and complaints.
*   **Finance Manager** manages payments, invoices, late payments and financial reports.
*   **Maintenance Staff** manages maintenance requests and logs in all the data once issues are resolved.
*   **Administrators** have full system access to a particular location to manage all user accounts, manage apartments, generate reports to assigned location, and track lease agreements such as end date of a lease.
*   **Manager** can oversee all apartment occupancy levels and generate various performance reports according to location. Manager can also expand the business in other cities.

**Tenant Management component** core functions include maintaining tenant records by adding, updating, and removing information, as well as tracking associated lease agreements, payment histories, and complaint logs. In some situations, tenants can also request to leave before the end of contract (they must give 1 month notice and as penalty pay 5% of their monthly rent).

**Apartment management component** core functions should include apartment registration with detailed attributes such as location, type, monthly rent, number of rooms etc.; assigning apartment to tenant to track occupancy; and managing the lifecycle of maintenance requests.

**The Payment & Billing Component manages** invoices, payments, late payments, and generates notification if the payment is late. Note that there is no need to integrate a payment processing system; the goal is only to emulate the payment process by generating the billing/dues receipts.

**The reporting component** provides essential operational insights through three key functions: generating occupancy reports filtered by apartment or city, producing financial summaries that compare collected versus pending rents, and tracking maintenance costs for effective budget management.

**The Maintenance component** Manages any maintenance issues that are reported by tenants. The maintenance staff investigates the issues, prioritises them, checks worker availability, communicates maintenance dates and times to tenants, resolves the issues, and records their resolution in the system. Staff also log the time taken to fix each issue and the associated costs.

Other suitable components are welcome which you think can add value to system & operation management. Also, your solution should include non-functional requirements (security, efficiency and scalability) features besides core functionalities.

More specifically there are following tasks:

You are asked to produce the following deliverables for the scenario given above.

**Task 1 (Portfolio 75%)**
**Element 1 (System Design- 35 marks)**
Element 1 requires you to produce (i) a use case diagram to capture the functionality for the system to be built. Your use case diagram should be self-explanatory, and you are not required to provide use case descriptions (ii) a class diagram to meet all the requirements captured in the use case diagram and (iii) at least three sequence diagrams for some use cases that adds information. Each sequence diagram should represent a single use case.

**Element 2 (System Development and Methodology- 30 marks)**
Develop the system using a suitable Object-Oriented Programming language (e.g., Python as we'll use python for this module) and Database(s) considering all the functionalities described above.
- You should design and implement suitable database(s) and fill it with suitable mock data for testing and demonstration purposes.
- You should be creative and come up with your own User Interface Design for different above-mentioned GUI needs.
- You should also implement non-functional requirements (e.g., security measures) to a good standard.
- Provide evidence of contribution and methodology used in the project. As evidence, you can write a joint report outlining the steps that you followed to develop the system in relation to an Agile development episode. Also, explicitly specify/show the contribution in the project.

**Please note that you are required to develop a desktop application. Website development is NOT permitted.**

**Element 3 (Testing- 10 marks)**
Testing is an essential part of the software development process. You should use test strategies (manual and automated) to test your implemented system thoroughly. You should identify suitable test cases for all the classes implemented in your system and test individual component as well as the integrated system. When you test your code, you should make sure that your program does not allow bad data to be stored into your objects. Deliberately input out-of-range or incorrect data into your program and try to make it fail. Check if you can insert invalid values into the member variables. One example test case is shown below. You should provide evidence (such as screenshots) of test cases. You can show screenshots in the actual output column (See sample Test Case table below).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Test Case #</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Test dataset/Input</th>

**Task 2 (Viva and Demo 25%)**
The second assessment task is viva and demo of the design, methodology, and overall implemented software solution. The demo will take place during your practical session time, following the submission of your portfolio. The demo/viva will provide you with the opportunity to present and explain your work based on which the quality of your portfolio will be determined. In the demo session, you are expected to show quality of software features, explain the applied software methodology, clarify individual contributions and the overall evaluation of the project.
**Note: All the members of the group must be present during the demonstration session. Passing both Task 1 and Task 2 is mandatory to complete this module.**

Your lab tutor will play role of representative of PAMS. If you have questions about this assignment, please discuss with your lab tutors. You may also post questions for your lab tutors on the discussion board in Blackboard. You can find the discussion board from the front page of the module Blackboard pages and use the forum under the title “Portfolio Queries”.

**Deliverables**
You must use the Blackboard electronic submission system to submit your work. Each student will have to upload complete package individually. Electronically submitted deliverables include:

# Marks and Feedback

**Portfolio carries 75% weight, and Demo/Viva carries 25% weight.**
It is common practice with all UWE standard undergraduate assessments, the pass mark to complete the module is 40%. Similarly, for this assessment (both Task 1 and Task 2), the pass mark is 40% for each task. Your assessment will be evaluated based on the marking criteria outlined in the rubrics (see marking criteria).

**You can use these to evaluate your own work before you submit.**

1.  UWE Bristol’s Academic Conduct Policy and Academic Misconduct Procedures (Assessment Offence Policy) is available from the [Academic Integrity](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/study/academic-integrity) webpages and requires that you submit work that is entirely your own and reflects your own learning, so it is important to:
    *   Ensure you reference all sources used, using the [UWE Harvard/OSCOLA](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/study/referencing) system (amend as appropriate) and the guidance available on [UWE’s Study Skills referencing pages](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/study/referencing).
    *   Refer to peer reviewed primary sources, rather than using AI or secondary sources
    *   Avoid copying and pasting any work into this assessment, including your own previous assessments, work from other students or internet sources
    *   Develop your own style, arguments and wording, so avoid copying sources and changing individual words but keeping, essentially, the same sentences and/or structures from other sources
    *   Never give your work to others who may copy it
    *   If an individual assessment, develop your own work and preparation, and do not allow anyone to make amends on your work (including proof-readers, who may highlight issues but not edit the work).

**When submitting your work, you will be required to confirm that the work is your own, and text-matching software and other methods are routinely used to check submissions against other submissions to the university and internet sources. Details of what constitutes plagiarism and how to avoid it can be found on UWE’s Study Skills [pages about avoiding plagiarism](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/study/avoiding-plagiarism).**
